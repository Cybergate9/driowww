So in [part one](http://www.datarefinery.io/blog/2016-01-14/) we have our [meteostick](http://www.smartbedded.com/wiki/index.php/Meteostick) connected to our machine via USB serial port emulation. The 'meteostick receiver' ([meteostickrx.js](https://github.com/ITWrangler/meteostick.js/blob/master/meteostickrx.js)) software is now a little more polished - we can let it run continuously gathering data from our Davis weather station into an SQLite database.

For me this means the meteostick is connected to a QNAP NAS, with the USB port 'mapped' (or 'connected') to a virtual machine (VM). The virtual machine ( running [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)) has had everything needed installed (as per [README](https://github.com/ITWrangler/meteostick.js/blob/master/README.md)) and runs meteostickrx.js 24x7.

What's obviously needed now is to get that data going 'somewhere' so we can view it - preferably as a graph. There are many services 'out there' to allow people with home weather stations to upload their data to ([WOW (uk)](http://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/), [WOW (au)](http://www.bom.gov.au/wow-support/) and many others), so not much point in re-inventing the wheel.

All that's needed is a module which reads the SQLite data on a schedule and 'pushes' it up to such a weather service - like [this](http://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/graphdata?requestedAction=REQUEST&siteID=952386001).

A relatively simple approach for this is a basic recursive function:

```
function readandupload()
      read last entry from database
      format it for upload
      upload to WOW website via API
      delay for X
      call readandupload()

call readandupload()
```
So that's essentially what [upload2wow.js](https://github.com/ITWrangler/meteostick.js/blob/master/upload2wow.js) does. It run continuously, and every 15 minutes (or as configured) uploads the latest readings (the last row in the database) to the UK WOW API.

It runs independently of [meteostickrx.js](https://github.com/ITWrangler/meteostick.js/blob/master/meteostickrx.js) as you'd expect - there is no need to 'couple' these two processes together (except to the extent that they both talk to the same database/schema).
