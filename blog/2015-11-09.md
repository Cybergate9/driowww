One of the most interesting things about 'big data' (I know it has many and
varied definitions, let's not get bogged down in that for now..) is that we don't
know if it's useful yet.

What did I just say!?

Yes, even though there has been billions of dollars invested in it, I'm fairly
sure we are still trying to answer that basic question - is it useful?

The next proposition is equally counter-intuitive.. it doesn't matter if it's useful right now..

'Ok Shaun.. what are you on about?'..

'Big data' is 'sold' as using 'shed loads' of data allowing us to analyse 'things',
apparently enabling better decision making, which, of course will lead to *bigger
profits*.

Simple! Or alternatively.. what load of 'hog wash' :-)

But that *is* how 'big data' is 'sold', and, boy, isn't it simplistic?
Not only does it over simplify, it asserts causal relationships which,
in my opinion, are pretty dubious (e.g. analysis leads to better decisions leads to profit..).

That doesn't stop people [making claims](http://theodi.org/the-value-of-open-data) that these types of causality exist. In these cases, which I believe *are* mostly efforts made in good faith, my rule of thumb is 'follow the money'. In the previous link the claims come from a report by [PwC](http://www.pwc.com/), commissioned by [ODI](http://theodi.org/faq) and [NESTA](http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/annual-report-and-accounts-year-ended-march-2015), who are both reliant on government funding for a significant part of their budget.

It doesn't matter if it's useful right now..

Well, it might to some, but 'in the round' it doesn't, because this is a definite case in my opinion where the *journey* is more important than the destination.

Stepping back, let's take a different angle. Computers are useful 'tools' for working
on, or enabling, 'ideas' (or thinking). Just like a piano is a useful 'tool'
for enabling music. This is an old idea, and came to me again via a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeFnRWx3tPg) of Alan Kay
speaking at a MIT Medialab event. So at the moment I think it's fair to say that
'Big Data' is more useful as another technology tool for 'exploring ideas' than it is as 'an end, in and of itself'.

That might bear some explanation.

Right now the main *drivers* for big data are advertising, social graph data-mining and the like - not things I'm particularly concerned about if I'm honest.

But, in turn, this innovation is 'pushing along' major developments in machine learning, statistical analysis, and visualisations. It is also 'pushing along' technology itself. The list is very long but in the 'big end' is: scaling, virtualisation, containerisation, storage, database technology, and all their related 'cloud based cousins'. The innovation is impacting all across the technology stack and this includes really fundamental pieces such as programming languages, packaging & deployment management, and technologies available for web and mobile development.

 So, right now,  I don't think that trying to measure 'big data' in dollars and cents terms is necessarily a useful exercise. Albiet, I understand, that those seeking government grants, or needing to impress in the boardroom, must try to do so.

 It is more than satisfactory to me that 'big data', if nothing else, will add massive value to the computer tools and data we have available to us. It is amplifying the ['network effect'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) even further. If this is then used to enable [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), better facts (data) available to the public, and better tools to find and explore that data with.. then I say 'the more the merrier' :-)
