Title:  Isn't this just ETL re-branded?

You might rightly argue that much of the hype around big data and data science is just Extract, Transform, Load ([ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)) re-branded. And it's true in the most basic sense that ETL remains a sub-set of these newer terms. Cynically, you might say, everything new is a re-branding of something old, in a marketing sense :-).

And whilst things are 'renewed', it still holds true that the primary challenge, effort wise, from ETL hasn't gone away - we continue to expect to spend the bulk of our time and energy in 'cleaning' data to make it useful.

But what's exciting about 'new approaches' is that the most advanced ETL approaches of old
are now pretty straight forward to implement using open source tools. Streaming and related pipelining techniques are easily implemented at much a smaller scale than was economic before.
Performance and parallelism, again, is available to smaller implementations due to it becoming 'baked into' new languages, frameworks and datastores. Combining these with the now near ubiquity of HTTP Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the near defacto adoption of the JSON ([Javascript Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)) as a standard data format is creating a powerful, well understood, technology 'stack'.

An interesting case in point is the newly developed [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/). As a test I recently proofed an 'ETL like pipeline' for [harvesting museum data](https://github.com/ITWrangler/adlibharvest.js) via the [Adlib](http://www.adlibsoft.com/products/museum-collection-management-software) API, transforming the result, and then splitting that into 'publishable' and 'not publishable' subsets. It required no more than javascript modules hooked onto RethinkDB's [changes() functionality](http://rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-rabbitmq/).

So, by choosing the right tools, you 'automatically' get some quite advanced ETL characteristics: in this case [Node.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) provides you native asynchronous programming support, whilst [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/) is handling all the 'heavy lifting' of 'pipelining' your data through multiple processing steps.
