### Isn't this just ETL re-branded?
*posted by Shaun, 18 July 2015*

You might rightly argue that much of the hype around big data and data science is just Extract, Transform, Load ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load]()ETL) re-branded. And it's true in the most basic sense.

It also still holds true that the primary challenge, effort wise, from ETL hasn't gone away - we continue to expect to spend the bulk of our time and energy in 'cleaning' data to make it useful.

But what's exciting about 'new' approaches is that the most advanced ETL approaches of old
are now pretty straight forward to implement using open source tools. Streaming and related pipelining techniques are easily implemented at much smaller scale than was possible before.
Performance and parallelism, again, is available to smaller implementations due to it becoming 'baked in' to new languages, frameworks and datastores. Combining these with the ubiquity of HTTP Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the near defacto adoption of the JSON ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON](Javascipt Object Notation)) format is creating a powerful, well understood, technology 'stack'.

A interesting case in point is the newly develop [http://rethinkdb.com/](RethinkDB). As a test I recently proofed an 'ETL like pipeline' for [https://github.com/ITWrangler/adlibharvest.js](harvesting museum data) via the Adlib API, transforming the result, and splitting it into 'publishable' and 'not publishable' subsets. It required no more than javascript modules hooked onto RethinkDB's [http://rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-rabbitmq/](changes() functionality).
