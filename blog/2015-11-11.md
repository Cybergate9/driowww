In [part 2](/blog/2015-11-08/) we talked about the first phase of converting text data into JSON -  a preprocessing step creating 'tagged data'.

In this part I'll try and cover some of the more interesting parts of the *data processing step*. The pre and data processors are both [javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and run on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

The data processing step (which is a slight misnomer as you will come to see) has one purpose - to convert 'tagged' data into a [JSON](http://json.org/) document containing a structure (mostly nesting and arrays) which accurately reflects the meaning of the pre-processed input. Just a reminder, we can forgot about the unprocessed data here - the only comparison for testing is whether the JSON faithfully represents the tagged data.

To take that idea logically further though, if it doesn't match (i.e. the JSON output here doesn't properly represent the *unprocessed* data) then the problem is almost certainly in the *pre-processor* code/step.

The last thing to say before looking into the pre-processed and JSON records, in the expandable boxes below, is that there will be a *remap processor* after this step.

This, again as described in the previous parts ([I](/blog/2015-08-28/) and [II](/blog/2015-11-08/)), was a simple decision about separation of concerns. Remember our ultimate target here is an indexer containing a schema and data created *for the UI developers* - getting bogged down in that detail at this stage would make the code way too complex, as well as not allowing us to have separate processors (at remap stage) for different parts of the collection should we need them.

#### Points of interest

So, the first thing to note is while this is both valid as a JSON object, and as a structural representation of the record, it is most definitely not *pretty* :-) . And remember this is a single record..

There's a variety of sub-structures - arrays, objects etc some which are just numbered, not even fielded yet.

Markers like "-subfield" (to group arrays together), and "-flushed" (to handle 'orphan' strings which usually belong to the group level we're at, but there's nothing explicit to say so in the raw or pre-processed data) are methods of explicitly 'fielding', structurally, what we 'saw' in the pre-proccessed data. Clearly they are not useful as a 'final schema', but as an interim step they try to make clear the interpretation of the pre-processed data.

Fields which 'drop out' properly are pretty much in their final form. Another choice was to standardise field names at this stage using ['camelCase'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) across the board - if you compare pre-processed to JSON it's easy to see.

Other fields are still not 'split out' - e.g. right from the top of the JSON,  "Author : Woodward A.S." is clearly a co-joined field+value still.

Hierarchies are the same - e.g. "artefact": "archival: book: facsimile~ archival: book ~ Archival ~ ../.." where the value is a hierarchy containing specific starters and separators which are not interpreted at this stage. The primary reason to not process Hierarchies until the remap stage is their complexity, or more precisely their variety. This is imposed by the complexity of the data in the source database, as well as the limitation of the reporting tools (to generate the raw data) in the source database. As examples - hierarchies can run forwards, or backwards, values can be typed (fielded) or not, fields:values can be transposed and on, and on... and on :-). So at data processing stage the best we can hope for is to get them in the right place in the structure cleanly.

Another bugbear, imposed by the limitation of reporting tools, is that some groups come out serially 'beside each other' - in the JSON above the first example of that is:
<pre>"searchKey": [
    [
     "Abbott, D. (1962)",
     "Abbott, D. & Deer, W.A. (1972)"
    ],
    "Allen, C.R. (1975)"
],
"bibliographicReference": [
    "Description : The Gabbro Cumulates of the Kap Edvard Holm complex, East Greenland",
    "Ph.D. thesis (Manchester)",
    "Description : The Gabbro Cumulates of the Kap Edvard Holm Lower Layered Series",
    "Meddelelser om Gronland",
    "Vol: 190, number 6",
    "Description : The Petrology of a portion of the Troodos Plutonic Complex, Cyprus",
    "Ph.D. thesis"
],
</pre>  
where the authors and the descriptions belong together but are only related by their order in 'searchKey' and 'bibliographicReference' arrays. This is a direct result of post-relational type systems, and you might see it quite a lot in cultural data from different institutions, coming out of post-relational collections management systems.

Once again, though, this is a structural issue in the source raw data. So it's a better choice to deal with this at 'remap' stage because during data processing we really are just trying to create an accurate representation of what the pre-processed data presents - in this case the data is *damn ugly* :-) but we are leaving *interpretation* (and fixes based on that interpretation) of the data to the remap phase. And, frankly, its much easier to deal with after this initial valid JSON record exists, because we know about these oddities and *precisely* where in the JSON structure they are going to occur (read: it's easier to code for when it's more explicit -  not great, just a bit easier..).

'Notes' fields crop up all over the place, and can exist at almost any level - keeping them in the right place can be a bit of a challenge, but again where oddities arise due to the raw data we pick them up later during remap.

So, as ugly as it all seems :-) ... the data processor is only a couple of hundred of lines of javascript code, and *relatively*, if not entirely, straightforward to understand. Getting the balance between generic and too complex was goal here, and keeping an eye on the end product was the key - we want JSON records which structurally represent the data we're getting, no more, no less. We'll leave the rest to the remap processor.
