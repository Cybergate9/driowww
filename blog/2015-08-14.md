Title:  well that was exciting.. not..

Well this website just disappeared.. or more precisely upon checking, its [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) server had disappeared!

And even more precisely its AWS micro instance was *terminated* - with no rhyme or reason - and definitely with nothing logged..

It was, however, a useful disaster recovery test.. which I was pretty happy with..

Within about 15 minutes I had a new instance (debian 8) running, all the stuff required back via apt-get (curl and io.js) and npm (jade, express, morgan, node-markdown) and the application re-cloned via [github](https://github.com/ITWrangler/driowww) and running again.. server secured and re-piped onto its [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) internet gateway address.. phew :-)

A salutory lesson in how to run cloud services, i.e. the box on the cloud should be reproducible in minutes, nothing stored on the cloud should be critical (I do log on the cloud machine but they are not critical, as analytics are via [GA](http://www.google.com/analytics/)), and finally one should read the AWS docs on [termination](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html) and [termination protection](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-console-features-forced-detach-termination-protection/).

Lessons learnt, minor panic over :-)
