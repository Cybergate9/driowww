### It’s not just big that’s interesting

What is ‘big data’?

Ask a handful of people and you are pretty much assured of 5 different answers.

For simplicity, a generally accepted characterisation is encapsulated in the four V’s:

- Volume – The quantity of data that is generated.

- Variety - The different types and possible inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times.

- Velocity - The speed of generation of data, or how fast the data is generated and processed.

- Veracity - The quality of the data, accuracy in analysis depends on the veracity of the source data

Here's a huge info graphic from the IBM ['Big Data and Analytics hub'](http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/) apparently explaining the 4 V's..

I think you'll agree that it's pretty 'full on'..

So, if you don’t have a zillion petabytes of data what good is ‘big data’ to you?

We believe the more salient point about big data is: due massive demand and investment it is developing new concepts, methods, and technologies which are useful to the *rest of us* (even if our 'big data' isn't so big...)

This is our area of expertise and interest.
