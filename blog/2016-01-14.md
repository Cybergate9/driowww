This is quite an interesting piece of kit - called [Meteostick](http://www.smartbedded.com/wiki/index.php/Meteostick) - a rf receiver for direct communication with [Davis weather station](http://www.davisnet.com/weather/) 'heads' (Vantage Vue, Pro and Pro2). It works in paralell with Davis consoles so both can be running together. It's a USB device presenting as a virtual comms port (VCP) - i.e. it presents to host system, with correct drivers, as a serial device.

For OS X or \*nix systems it should just mount automatically on a /dev/tty* type device (varies as to what it'll be called, e.g. on OS X for me it's /dev/cu.usbserial-AI02XBCI, and on Debian it's /dev/ttyUSB0). For Windows [device drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm) will need to be installed. Once that's all good you can send and receive from it like a 'normal' serial device.

Most interestingly, from a development perspective, it offers the opportunity to code 'from the ground up' for receiving and processing a live 'stream' of data. This is of course an 'Internet of Things' (IoT) type of device - capable of generating 'live' data 24x7.

So, as an exercise, I'm going to use this as a test bed for developing some IoT tools and tests. I'm choosing Node.js for development as it's a good fit for streaming type work.

The first step is to get communication happening - [msfirsttest.js](https://github.com/ITWrangler/meteostick.js/blob/master/msfirsttest.js) is a basic example of this.

We can then move onto something more interesting - [meteostickrx.js](https://github.com/ITWrangler/meteostick.js/blob/master/meteostickrx.js) (meteostick receiver) is a simple receive module, which will run forever, outputting data to the console as CSV or JSON, or alternatively to a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.
