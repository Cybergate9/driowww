Title:  Text to Records, Part II

In [part 1](/blog/2015-08-28/) we talked about converting text data into JSON.

In this part I'll try and cover some of the more interesting early stage aspects of this data conversion.
What makes this conversion interesting is the data itself.
It's being drawn from an old-style post-relational database and the data representation contains pretty much every variation of structural data you're likely to see (groups, arrays, heirarchies, groups of arrays, arrays of heirarchies etc).

As explained [previously](/blog/2015-08-28/)  I decided early on to split the processing into multiple steps.
This was a pragmatic development decision (as well as a sanity saving exercise) following the normal 'divide and conquer' solution path. The first stage is simply to read the input file, interpret it based on known rules (which have been developed interatively between the data expert and myself), and create an output file
which has everything explicity tagged, one thing per line. It might be a good time to look briefly at unprocessed and pre-processed files in the expandable boxes below.

It's worth noting that even this first stage is not trivial - about half a dozen iterations have been required with a data expert and myself. The templates to create the original file (which are created by the data expert) are fiddly and time consuming and require an intimate knowledge of the source database, and even more importantly how the data has been entered over the years at the [Sedgwick Museum](http://www.sedgwickmuseum.org/). This just reinforces, and it's a point I've made many times before, that a local data expert is always required in addition to a technologist when doing 'data wrangling' - and the time required of the local data expert can be quite considerable.

#### Points of interest

Top level fields (e.g  "§ Physical description :") allow us to break the record into groupings. The structure within each grouping is arbitrary and the preprocessor doesn't care. These get explicitly tagged as '[new top field]' (see the preprocessed data)

Muli-groups/fields (e.g. ""† Identification type : Identification 05 Simple name :
  Artefact : archival: book: facsimile~ archival: book ~ Archival ~ ../..‡"") have been delineated using specific beginning (†) and ending (‡) characters. Again the preprocessor doesn't care what's in it, or how many lines it spans. This is important because of the limitations of the text reporting formatting available to us. The source data is drawn from (at least) dozens of post-relational tables during report writing (which is what creates the unprocessed original) and complex data is drawn together and grouped during this process. For preprocessing all I worry about is cleanly getting this 'group' out of the source file as a single tagged item. These all turn into "[new bracket value]"'s in the preprocessed data.   
  The most complex of data lives in these 'bracket(ed) values' and we leave actually interpreting the data until later.

Sub & Sub-Sub fields (e.g. a created sequence in the preprocessed data) like:
  - [new top field] § Identification numbers :
  - [new field] Object number : Test-DDF-OPAC-#1
  - [new sub field] Other number :

are derived by layout rules (e.g. a field name followed by a colon but no value is meaningful, it creates a subfield in the current field). Not much structural processing is done by the preprocessor but very clear sequences are created which make later processing somewhat easier.

Obviously I won't bore you with all of the possibilities, suffice it to say that there's meaning in the limited number of 'tags' (e.g. [new sub field]) and the order they appear in - this reflects the 'rules' followed in the formatting in the original source.

In theory then, if in future a new type of report needs to be created, providing the basic 'rules' are followed, the preprocessor won't need to be changed. It's already being used to process exports from different parts of the collection successfully - the data changes but the same structural rules are followed.

There is very little code which is specific to the data contents here. In an ideal world it would be 'algorithmically neutral' - i.e. would not rely on reading 'fields' or any other specifics in the data. In practice the development time required to be that generic is 'too expensive' (read: I don't have that much time.. I'm doing this on a voluntary basis..) so there is a couple of clearly commented pieces of code which rely on very common fields (e.g. always expected) used for the preprocessor to keep track of where it's at. Just a reminder here that the example we've been using is one record - the preprocessor is designed to handle thousands of records per file.

To summarise, the preprocessors job is to clearly 'tag' and 'order' what it 'sees' in the unprocessed data according to known rules. The next step, the *data processor* can then concentrate on just that. With the preprocessed input the data processor has a new set of rules which are far more limited in complexity because it can rely on the tagging, ordering and layout it's receiving. This is good.. because the data processor has a far more complicated job - it needs to interpret the data and its structure and create valid, complex, JSON records.
