We have over a decades experience in the UK museum's sector, allowing us to bring particular vertical expertise to solving your problems in this area.

Our particular interests in the cultural sector relate to our core business:

* Open Data. Having travelled the landscape from XML/XSLT, OAI-PMH, and Dublin Core to RESTful JSON based API's and CIDOC-CRM triplestores we can certainly help you in this area.

* Collections Management and Digital Asset Management. As the 'primary business applications' in a museum we have extensive experience assessing, customising, and integrating these systems into your organisations larger 'data landscape'.

* Services Integrations.  If you want good data services you are going to need good workflows, with systems and tool integrations to make them work. Our expertise in this area is based on building such things.

* Online Resources. We have experience developing online resources using your data - using both vendor's systems or creating these web applications/systems from scratch.

And in a general sense we can help with strategy, planning, and project management to get you on your path to solving your data problems.

We know we don't know everything. Where we believe you need different/additional expertise we'll say so, and recommend partners we can team up with to help you to get your job done.

Do [get in touch](/contact/) if you'd like further information.
