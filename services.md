We specialise in technologies related to data production, processing and integrations and using that data to help you build knowledge systems with your data.

Some call this 'big data', or 'data science', or 'ETL', or 'middleware' -  we call it 'getting your job done' :-)

In this, our initial phase of expansion, where possible, we're going to operate in 'internet only mode' - this keeps our overheads low and means we can pass these savings on to you.

We have a special interest in solving [data problems](/blog/2015-07-23/) in the cultural sector and for [Museums](/museums/) in particular.

We can help with:

* Data Cleansing.
* Data Processing/Conversions.
* API and Integration development.
* Open Data design & deployments.
* Web or Mobile applications built using your data.
* Application, API and data hosting.

If you care about such details we have up to date skills including:

* Language experience: formerly C and Perl, these days mostly PHP or Javascript
* Used to working in environments such as: Windows, Linux, and OSX on single servers/machines, on VMware installations, or on Amazon EC2 (AWS)
* Used to working on web servers based on Apache or Node.js on Windows/Linux/OSX
