We specialise in technologies related to data production, processing, integrations and use.

Some call this 'big data', or 'data science', or 'ETL', or 'middleware' -  we call it 'getting your job done' :-)

In this, our initial phase of expansion, we're going to operate in 'internet only mode' - this keeps our overheads low and means we can pass this value onto you.

We can help with:

* Data Cleansing.
* Data Processing/Conversions.
* API Development.
* Open Data design & deployments.
* Hosting your data.
