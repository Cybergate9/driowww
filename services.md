We specialise in technologies related to data production, processing, integrations and using that data to build knowledge systems for analytics, online catalogues etc.

Some call this 'big data', or 'data science', or 'ETL', or 'middleware' -  we call it 'getting your job done'.

In this, our initial phase of expansion, where possible, we're going to operate in 'internet only mode' - this keeps our overheads low and means we can pass these savings onto you.

We have a special interest in solving [data problems](/blog/2015-07-23/) in the cultural sector and for [Museums](/museums/) in particular.
