We specialise in technologies related to data production, processing and integrations, and using those systems to help you build knowledge based applications for the web or mobile.

Some call this 'big data', or 'ETL', or 'middleware' -  we call it 'getting your job done' :-)

In this, our initial phase of expansion, where possible, we're going to operate in 'internet only mode' - this keeps our overheads low and means we can pass these savings on to you.

We have a special interest in solving [data problems](/blog/2015-07-23/) in the cultural sector and for [Museums](/museums/) in particular.

In a general sense we can help with strategy, planning and project management to get you moving along the path towards solving your data problems.

In specific sense we can help with technicals like:

* Data Cleansing.
* Data Processing/Conversions.
* API and Integration development.
* Open Data design & deployments.
* Web or Mobile applications built using your data.
* Application, API and data hosting.

If you care about such details we have up to date skills including:

* Language experience: formerly C and Perl, these days mostly PHP or Javascript
* Used to working in environments such as: Windows, Linux, and OSX on single servers/machines, on VMware installations, or on Amazon EC2 (AWS)
* Used to working on web servers based on Apache or Node.js on Windows/Linux/OSX
* Data store and indexer experience includes: MySQL, some MSSQL, Elasticsearch, RethinkDB
* Current vendor systems experience with Adlib (collections management) and Portfolio (digital asset management) with a raft of other server based systems experience in the past.

We know we don't know everything. Where we believe you need different/additional expertise we'll say so, and recommend partners we can team up with to help you to get your job done.
