In a specific sense, we can help with technicals like:

* Open Data design & deployments.
* Web or Mobile applications built using your data.
* Application, API and data hosting.

If you care about such things we have up to date skills including:

* Language experience: formerly C and Perl, these days mostly PHP or Javascript (Node.js/io.js), with a smattering of Go..
* Used to working in environments such as: Windows, Linux, and OSX on single servers/machines, or on VMware infrastructue, or on Amazon EC2 (AWS)
* Used to working on web servers based on Apache or Node.js on Windows/Linux/OSX
* Data store and indexer experience includes both SQL and NoSQL and in particular: MySQL, Elasticsearch, RethinkDB, good exposure to mongodb and couchdb, some MSSQL and Postgres, and a dabbling in triplestores (4Store)...
* Current vendor systems experience with Adlib (collections management) and Extensis Portfolio (digital asset management) with a raft of other server based systems experience in the past.

We have had a special interest in solving [data problems](/blog/2015-07-23/) in the cultural sector and for [Museums](/museums/) in particular.

We know we don't know everything. Where we believe you need different/additional expertise we'll say so, and recommend partners we can team up with to help you to get your job done.
