We are web technology specialists particularly interested in data production, processing/integration, and using those systems to help you build knowledge based applications for the web or mobile.

In a general sense we can help with technical strategy, planning, and project management to get you moving along the path towards solving your data problems.

In specific sense we can help with technicals like:

* Data Cleansing.
* Data Processing/Conversions.
* API and Integration development.
* Open Data design & deployments.
* Web or Mobile applications built using your data.
* Application, API and data hosting.

If you care about such things we have up to date skills including:

* Language experience: formerly C and Perl, these days mostly PHP or Javascript (Node.js/io.js), with a smattering of Go..
* Used to working in environments such as: Windows, Linux, and OSX on single servers/machines, or on VMware infrastructue, or on Amazon EC2 (AWS)
* Used to working on web servers based on Apache or Node.js on Windows/Linux/OSX
* Data store and indexer experience includes both SQL and NoSQL and in particular: MySQL, Elasticsearch, RethinkDB, good exposure to mongodb and couchdb, some MSSQL and Postgres, and a dabbling in triplestores (4Store)...
* Current vendor systems experience with Adlib (collections management) and Extensis Portfolio (digital asset management) with a raft of other server based systems experience in the past.

We have had a special interest in solving [data problems](/blog/2015-07-23/) in the cultural sector and for [Museums](/museums/) in particular.

We know we don't know everything. Where we believe you need different/additional expertise we'll say so, and recommend partners we can team up with to help you to get your job done.
