We specialise in technologies related to data production, processing and integrations, and using those systems to help you build knowledge based applications for the web or mobile.

Some call this 'big data', or 'ETL', or 'middleware' -  we call it 'getting your job done' :-)

In this, our initial phase of expansion, where possible, we're going to operate in 'internet only mode' - this keeps our overheads low and means we can pass these savings on to you.

We have a special interest in solving [data problems](/blog/2015-07-23/) in the cultural sector and for [Museums](/museums/) in particular.

In a general sense we can help with strategy, planning and project management to get you moving along the path towards solving your data problems.

In specific sense we can help with technicals like:

* Data Cleansing.
* Data Processing/Conversions.
* API and Integration development.
* Open Data design & deployments.
