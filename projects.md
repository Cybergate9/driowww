Our 'product' is your problem.
That might bear a little explanation: we don't sell software or hardware, or even just our time.. we solve your problems and/or create the new services you want.
That's our product - solving problems.
If that needs hosting, development, project management, partnering, or other 'enablers' we do these as part of the bigger picture of 'getting your job done'.. check out [services](/services/), and if you'd like to work with us please get [in touch](/contact/).

We don't sell software as we believe both philosophically, and as a business model, that open source software is the way forward. So we participate in open source software (OSS) communities, and create open licenced software, by choice. We believe that rapid improvements in technology will only be achieved by open data and software - the optimistic end of this scale is expressed in books like the ['Second Machine Age'](http://secondmachineage.com/).
